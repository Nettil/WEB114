   <h2>1.  When would you use a switch statement in your projects?

</h2>
    <p>
    One situation where you would need to use a switch statement is if you wanted to display different messages for a user that change depending on their input
   <script>
    "use strict";
 const favDay = prompt("What is your favorite day of the week? (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)");

 switch (favDay.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'sunday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'monday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'tuesday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'wednesday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'thursday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'friday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    case 'saturday':
    console.log("Your favorite day is "+ favDay)
    break
    default:
    console.log("day not valid")

    }
