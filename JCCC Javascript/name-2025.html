    <h2>
        Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.
        (There are many answers to this question. )
    </h2>
    <p>
        One situation where you would need to create an if statement is if you
        need to compare two values
    </p>

    <h2>When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored?</h2>
    <p>
        When comparing values, the result is stored as the bool data type which
        represents a boolean variable
