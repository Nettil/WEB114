   <h2>1.  When would you use a switch statement in your projects?

</h2>
    <p>
    One situation where you would need to use a switch statement is if you wanted to display different messages for a user that change depending on their input
   <script>
    "use strict";
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
       console.log("loading slot  " + (i+1));
    }
 
   </script>
    </body>
